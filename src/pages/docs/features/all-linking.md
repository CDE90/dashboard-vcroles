## What is all linking?

All linking is a feature that allows you to link a role to all voice channels in your server. This is useful if you want to give a role to members who join any channel, without having to link each channel individually.

The basic concept is the same explained on the [linking page](/docs/features/linking#what-are-links), but instead of linking a single channel, you link all channels.

## How can I make an all link?

The easiest way to create an all link, is using our [dashboard](/dashboard), which we will explain below. You can also use the [/all link](/docs/commands/all-linking#all-link) command in the server you wish to link the role. Or the [/all unlink](/docs/commands/all-linking#all-unlink) command to remove an all link.

### Using the dashboard

1. Navigate to your server's [dashboard](/dashboard) and click on the "Linked Channels" tab.

2. To create an all link, set the link type to "All" and click "Create".

3. Select a role to link to all channels and click "Save".

4. That's it! You have linked all channels in your server. You can now unlink them at any time.

### Using the commands

You can also use the commands to create an all link. You can find more information about the commands on the [commands page](/docs/commands/all-linking).

## But what if I want to link a role to all channels, except one?

You can use the exclude channels option to select a channel to exclude from an all link. Or you can use the [/all exclude add](/docs/commands/all-linking#all-exclude-add) and [/all exclude remove](/docs/commands/all-linking#all-exclude-remove) commands to add or remove channels from an all link.

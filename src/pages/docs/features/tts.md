## What is text-to-speech?

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a feature which allows users to read a message in a voice channel. This is useful if you need to speak but can't use your microphone.

## How can I use text-to-speech?

The easiest way to manage TTS settings is using our [dashboard](/dashboard). You can also use the [TTS commands](/docs/commands/tts) to manage TTS settings.

### Managing TTS settings with the dashboard

1. Navigate to your server's [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Select your server from the list
3. Click on the "Server Settings" tab
4. Toggle the "Enable TTS" switch to enable TTS
5. That's it! You can now use TTS in your server

### Managing TTS settings with commands

1. Enable TTS using the [/tts setup](/docs/commands/tts#tts-setup) command
2. That's it! You can now use TTS in your server

## How can I play a message?

To play a message, you must be in a voice channel. You can then use the [/tts play](/docs/commands/tts#tts-play) command to play a message.

## How can I stop playing a message?

To stop playing a message, you must be in a voice channel. You can then use the [/tts stop](/docs/commands/tts#tts-stop) command to stop playing the current message.

## What is the server list?

The server list is a list of all the servers you have VC Roles in. You can use the server list to quickly navigate to your server's dashboard.

The server list only shows servers where you are either the owner or have administrator permissions.

If you want to add VC Roles to your server, you can use the [invite link](/invite).

## How can I use the server list?

You can use the server list by going to the [dashboard](/dashboard) page.

To get to your server's dashboard, click on the "View Dashboard" button below your server's name and icon.

## What if I don't see my server in the server list?

If you don't see your server in the server list, it's likely that you don't have administrator permissions in your server.

You can check if you have administrator permissions by going to your server's settings and checking the "Roles" tab.

If you don't have administrator permissions, you can ask your server owner to add VC Roles to your server.

## What if I don't see the server list?

If you don't see the server list, it's likely that you are not logged in.

You can log in by clicking on the "Login" button in the top right corner of the page.

## What if I don't see the "View Dashboard" button?

If you don't see the "View Dashboard" button, you will instead see a "Add Bot" button. Clicking on this button will add VC Roles to your server, and navigating back to the page will show the "View Dashboard" button.

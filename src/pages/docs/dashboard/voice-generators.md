## What is the voice generators page?

The voice generators page allows you to view the voice generators in your server. You can use the page to see all settings for each voice generator.

Currently you can only view the voice generators, you cannot edit them from the dashboard. See the [voice generators docs](/docs/features/voice-generators) for more information.

## How can I view voice generators?

2. Select your server from the list
3. Click on the "Voice Generators" tab
